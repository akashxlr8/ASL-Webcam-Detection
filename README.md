# ASL Webcam Detection using OpenCV

![ASL Webcam Detection](https://github.com/akashxlr8/ASL-Webcam-Detection/blob/main/sign-language-lead.gif?raw=true)

## Overview
This GitHub repository houses an application developed to detect American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using a webcam. Leveraging the power of OpenCV, this project aims to provide real-time ASL interpretation by analyzing video input from a webcam.

## Features
- Real-time ASL gesture detection: The application captures video frames from a webcam and employs a robust computer vision algorithm to detect and recognize ASL gestures.
- Multiple gesture recognition: The system is capable of recognizing a wide range of ASL gestures, including letters, numbers, and common phrases.
- User-friendly interface: The application offers an intuitive graphical user interface that allows users to easily interact with the system and view the detected ASL gestures in real-time.
- Adjustable parameters: Users can fine-tune various parameters such as detection sensitivity, frame rate, and display options to suit their specific requirements.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
